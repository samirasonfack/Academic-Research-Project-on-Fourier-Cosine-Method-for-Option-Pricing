# Academic-Research-Project-on-Fourier-Cosine-Method-for-Option-Pricing
This work based on a paper by Fang and Osterlee published in 2008 on Fourier Cosine Expansion for option pricing explores an approach to upgrade this efficient numerical technique that demands some parameters difficult to estimate by relying on mathematical foundation and deep learning insights.
